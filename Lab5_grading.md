Recall the [Assignment](https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~tjp/cs50/labs/lab5/).

**Total: 68/100 points**

## (10) Overall

8/10 points:

* -2 for lack of git commits and meaningful messages (I currently just see a bunch of commits for submission).

## (10) Makefiles

7/10 points:

* -3 for compilation warnings in common Makefile
* Great job on your indexer makefile!

## (10) Documentation

10/10 points:

* Great documentation!

## (10) Testing

8/10 points:

* -2 for lack of testing (it looks like you just test assign the directories and test invalid stuff)

## (20) Coding Style

17/20 points:

* -3 for lack of comments on all files

## (30) Functionality

10/30 points:

* -20 for failure to compile (please see me with questions on this part) on test cases (and in lack of testing in indextest.c). I think the way you're building the test filename may be bugged, but in any case, I get "invalid page directory" on every test case. 

## (10) Memory leaks, according to valgrind

8/10 points:

* -2 for small memory errors in the beginning with formulating the page directory. 

## Late penalties

* None
